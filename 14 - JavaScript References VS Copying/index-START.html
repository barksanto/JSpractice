    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
      // team is just a reference to the original array - not a different array
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = "Lux";
    // however what happens when we update that array?
     
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = team.slice();
    // one way
    team2[3] = "Lux";
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    //takes every item out of our iterable and puts them into the containing array
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "yeehawwww"
    // console.log(team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 99; // doesnt work , like the original example because we're changing the original array
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // start with empty object, pass it the obj we want to copy properties from, then fold in the new properties we want to overwrite
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 1, number: 99});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // works the same as array spread
    const cap3 = {...person} // not in JS YET
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const bark ={
      name: 'barkley',
      age: 27,
      social: {
        fb: 'blue',
        gh: 'black'
      }
    }

    // const dev = Object.assign({}, bark);
    // dev.name = "BARKS"
    // dev.social.fb = 'newFACE' // BAD this changes the value of original object too because assign only goes 1 level deep
    // theres a method called deepclone we can use - find in goodgle
    // POOR MANS deepclone - parse it into a string and then back into an object
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(bark));
    dev2.social.twitter = "NEWtwitter"
